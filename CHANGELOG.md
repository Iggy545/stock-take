# Change register — Soulful Angels Till & Stock

Every version published to https://iggy545.github.io/stock-take/ is recorded here.
The version at the top of this file is what the app's header shows, so you can tell
at a glance which build a phone or till is running.

Version numbering: the middle number goes up for new features, the last number for
fixes.

## v1.0.0 — 17 August 2026

First version to carry a version number. Everything before this was published without
one, which is why older builds show no version line in the header.

### Added
- **Version stamp in the header.** Shows `v1.0.0 · 17 Aug 2026` on every tab, so you
  can confirm which build a device is running without opening anything.
- **"Closes after each scan" toggle in the scanner.** The camera now shuts down after a
  successful scan instead of staying open. The toggle switches it back to staying open
  for working through a pile of stock, and the choice is remembered on that device.

### Fixed
- **CSV exports mangled em dashes and accents.** Names containing `—` came out as `â€”`
  when opened in Excel. All three exports (stock take, sales, end-of-day report) now
  start with a UTF-8 marker so Excel reads them correctly. Re-export any affected file
  to get a clean copy.

### Notes
- A failed scan (unknown code, no stock left, promo code on the wrong tab) deliberately
  leaves the camera open so the code can be presented again.
- Scanning an unknown barcode still closes the camera and opens the add-item form, as before.

## Before v1.0.0

Published by hand without version numbers or a change record. The last such build went
live on 17 July 2026. Its history is not recoverable — this register starts here.
